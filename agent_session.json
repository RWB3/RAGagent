It is particularly useful for optimizing complex search spaces, including real-valued, discrete, and conditional dimensions. Hyperopt is commonly used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for models, which can significantly improve model performance."

WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface): A specification for how web servers communicate with web applications in Python. It standardizes the interaction to improve portability and scalability. WSGI consists of two primary components: the server/gateway and the application. It is detailed in PEP 3333 and is the standard for deploying Python web applications, used by frameworks like Django and Flask.\n\n2. Python: A high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility, supporting procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.\n\n3. Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python that is easy to start with and can scale to more complex applications.\n\n4. Hyperopt: An open-source Python library for distributed and asynchronous hyperparameter optimization, useful in machine learning for optimizing model hyperparameters."
